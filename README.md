# MacWikiDemo

A Mac SwiftUI project demonstrating how to create a master-detail interface.

The master view shows a list of pages. Select a page to show the page's contents in the detail view.

The detail view has two views: a text view where you type Markdown and a web view that shows HTML.

## System Requirements

Xcode 13
macOS 11+

## Adding Pages

Click the Add button at the bottom of the list to add a new page.

## Renaming Pages

Select the page from the sidebar and press the Return key to rename the page.

I find that with SwiftUI that all you have to do is select the page to change the page name. I consider it a bug.

## Deleting Pages

Select the page and press the Delete key to delete a page.

You may have to press the Esc key afer selecting the page to select the page instead of renaming it.
